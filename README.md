## [We Split](https://github.com/mbrychczynski/swift-iOS/tree/main/WeSplitSwiftUI)
My first iOS App. A check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant – you enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.

>|            |  @FocusState |

In this project, I learned about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps. I also learned how to build forms and sections, create navigation views and navigation bar titles. Additionally, I discovered how to store program state using the @State and @FocusState property wrappers. I gained knowledge on creating user interface controls such as TextField and Picker, and I learned how to generate views in a loop using ForEach.
