The app is designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:
* When do they want to wake up?
* Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
* How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

Once the user gives those three values, the app will feed them into Core ML to get a result telling the user when he/she ought to go to bed.

My first iOS App. A check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant – you enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.

In this project, I learned about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps. I also learned how to build forms and sections, and create navigation views and navigation bar titles. Additionally, I discovered how to store program state using the @State and @FocusState property wrappers. I learned how to create user interface controls such as TextField and Picker and how to generate views in a loop using ForEach.
